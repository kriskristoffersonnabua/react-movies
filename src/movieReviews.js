      'Not fully aware of paige and her families history and due to that i may have fewer things i dislike about it. The movie was pretty good for a casual fan you will obviously know some things were added to make it more interesting although a little bit more effort could have been added. Zelina Vega in no way represented AJ Lee from her look our even attire which i felt they may have gotten lazy on. Overall pretty decent movie felt a bit rushed and like some info was left out but was a nice attempt at putting a biopic of sorts together on a person who doesnt have extended history and a long list of memorable events in her career. I think a few other female superstars could have shined better with something like this but for what it was worth it was watchable.',

      "A movie, whether based on a true story or fictional one, or maybe a blend of both facts and fictionalized scenes and events - well, just watch and enjoy this one folks, don't be overly-critical all the time. 'Fighting with my Family' is inspired by the story of the Knight family.",
